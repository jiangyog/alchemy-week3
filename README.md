# -What have you learned?
Learned how to deploy smart contracts on Polygon and Mint NFT on the chain

# -What do you like about this tutorial?
It's easy to use and very interesting. One contract can be deployed in one hour. It's very efficient. I like it. Especially the great gods of Alchemy community


# What technologies did you use?
Javascript,VsCode, Hardhat, Openzeppelin and Solidity for smart contracts.
PolygonScan chain and OpenSea NFT Check.

# How do you think you can use this technology to build useful applications in the future? 
NFT is an activity voucher on the block. It is very affordable to create NFT on Polygon. The gas fee is as low as 0.001 Matic Through this tutorial, I think that if I want to do community activities in the future, I can use this course to create community NFT. Just a few steps:
1.Create a basic sample project
2.Install the OpenZeppelin smart contract library
3.Modify the hardhat.config. js file
4.Create SOL Smart Contract
5.Create the Deployment Script
6.Compile and Deploy the smart contract


# Who would you recommend this project to?
Anyone interested in web3 and/or blockchain development
